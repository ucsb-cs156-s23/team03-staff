Bring over frontend crud files for 3rd Model from team01

# Acceptance Criteria:

All of the following refer to the forms, tables, pages, etc. for the frontend of the CRUD operations for the 3rd model added in team01 (in addition to Restaurant).  I suggest that you edit this issue to put  the name of that model in the title.

- [ ] The relevant Form and Table components along with the tests and storybook entries have been copied from team01 into team03
- [ ] The relevant pages, along with the tests and storybook entries have been copied from team01 into team03
- [ ] Temporarily, the `utils` files that implement CRUD operations on local storage have been copied over. (We'll modify this in a series of later issues to use the real backend instead).
- [ ] The necessary changes have been made in `App.js` and the `AppNavbar.js` for the pages to be accessible
- [ ] All components and pages have storybook entries
- [ ] All code is green on CI (i.e. Github Actions are ✅ not ❌ )
